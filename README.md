# King-County-Regression
<p>This is my first Machine Learning Project</p>
<p>I not very good at ML but I am still learning</p>
<p>This is done using a code along video of a <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-tensorflow-2-and-keras-deep-learning-bootcamp/">Udemy Course</a>
The Course Instructor <b>Jose Portilla</b>did a very good job explaining the stuff</p>
